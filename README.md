# Dublin Rentals Analysis üèôÔ∏è

This project analyzes historical Dublin rental listing data to uncover trends in pricing, property features, lease durations, and neighborhood patterns. The data was originally scraped from a university-hosted website that is no longer publicly accessible.

## üìÅ Project Structure

- `Task1.ipynb` ‚Äì Web scraping logic used to originally collect rental data across multiple quarters *(now based on archived content)*
- `Task2.ipynb` ‚Äì Data cleaning, preprocessing, and exploratory analysis including pricing trends and amenity impacts
- `all_rental_records.csv` ‚Äì Final processed dataset of Dublin rental listings

## üß∞ Technologies Used

- Python 3
- `BeautifulSoup` for HTML parsing
- `urllib` for archived web content requests
- `pandas`, `numpy` for data wrangling
- `matplotlib` for data visualization
- `re` for regex-based preprocessing

## üîç Key Insights

- **Price Range:** ‚Ç¨670 ‚Äì ‚Ç¨7,640, with a median around ‚Ç¨2,090
- **Property Size:** Most listings are 1‚Äì2 bedroom, 1‚Äì2 bathroom
- **Amenities:** Listings with gardens or parking command a higher price (~‚Ç¨2,000 more)
- **Lease Lengths:** 12-month leases dominate; shorter leases are rare but slightly more expensive
- **Seasonality:** Prices tend to rise toward Q4; Q3 may offer lower average prices
- **Location Impact:**
  - **North Dublin**: More budget-friendly
  - **South Dublin**: High-end market (notably D4, D6, D16)
  - **Hotspots**: Dublin 24, 17, and 15 offer good rental value

## üë®‚Äçüíª Target Audiences

- **Renters** ‚Äì Make informed decisions based on lease length, amenities, and timing
- **Investors** ‚Äì Evaluate return potential by property feature and location
- **Market Analysts** ‚Äì Identify seasonal and geographic rental trends

## üìà Future Extensions

- Integrate geographic visualizations (e.g., postal code heatmaps)
- Train ML models to predict rental prices
- Extend analysis to include more recent datasets (if available)
